### Requirements

1. Hyprlock - `sudo pacman -S hyprlock`
2. Hyprpaper - `sudo pacman -S hyprpaper` (responsible to load the beautiful 4k background that you get in this repo)

And hyprland obviously comes with it.

### How to use it

Step 1 : Backup you existing hyprland.conf which is in ~/.config/hypr

`mv ~/.config/hypr ~/.config/hypr-backup`

Step 2 : Clone this repo to ~/.config/hypr 

`git clone https://github.com/dibyacodes/arch-hyprland.git ~/.config/hypr`

**If you have the dependencies installed**, the you should see the changes
If not, then restart hyprland and enjoy!
